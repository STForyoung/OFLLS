            Description - Optical Fiber Liquid Level Sensor
            <br/> <br/>
            I worked on this project with my professor during my first year of college. It was a good learning experience for me as I learned and built a cool 
            application of fiber optics - a marketable product which could be used by many companies. See more about
            this below.
